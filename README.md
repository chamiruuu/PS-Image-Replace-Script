#🌟How It Works
Awaken the Script: Run the script through File > Scripts and choose your freshly crafted tool.
Folder Selection Ritual: If it's your first time, the script will guide you to choose the folder of images destined for your project.
Image Transformation: Watch as the script performs its alchemy, replacing the REPLACE_IMG_HERE layer with your chosen image.
Canvas Perfection: The script fits and centers the image on the canvas, ensuring your artistic vision is perfectly displayed.

🚀 Installation
Place the script in your Photoshop scripts directory:
Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop <version>\Presets\Scripts
macOS: /Applications/Adobe Photoshop <version>/Presets/Scripts
Re-launch Photoshop to see the new script under File > Scripts.
🛠️ Usage
Open your canvas of creativity—a Photoshop document featuring a REPLACE_IMG_HERE and a frame_img layer.
Invoke the script from File > Scripts > [Your Script Name].
If this is your first invocation, you'll be prompted to select your image folder.
The script takes it from there, cycling through images and replacing the placeholder layer, one image at a time.
Receive alerts about your progress and keep your workflow flowing seamlessly.
💡 Notes
Ensure your document includes the REPLACE_IMG_HERE and frame_img layers for perfect results.
The script processes .jpg files by default. For other file types, adjust the script settings.
Make sure you have a Photoshop action named "Convert to Smart Object" in the "pbsm" action set for the Smart Object conversion to work.
